This is a ROS-based online transfer learning framework for human classification in 3D LiDAR scans, taking advantage of robust multi-target tracking to avoid the need for data annotation by a human expert.

## How to build ##
```sh
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone -b multisensor https://github.com/yzrobot/online_learning.git
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
